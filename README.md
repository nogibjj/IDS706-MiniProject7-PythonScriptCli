# Rewrite a Python Script in Rust

## Goal

> Duke University IDS 706 Weekly Mini Project 8

- Take an existing Python script for data processing
- Rewrite it in Rust
- Highlight improvements in speed and resource usage


## Explanation

Since I have already done the Rust Script in mini project 7, therefore, I implemented the Python script in this project.
Then I compare the performance between Python and Rust.

## Preparation

For the Rust script, please refer to [here](https://github.com/nogibjj/IDS706-MiniProject7-RustScriptCli)

As for the Python script, just use this script.

`python main.py "Your Plaintext" shift`


## Performance comparison report

For the comparison, I use the same plaintext and shift number to test the performance.
